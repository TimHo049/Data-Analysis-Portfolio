## Tim Ho 
## About
Hi, I'm Tim!
I hold a degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and recently completed a postgraduate certificate in Business Analytics at George Brown College in Toronto. My academic background in science taught me how to think critically and solve complex problems, and my experience in digital marketing sparked a strong interest in data analysis.

After working in marketing analytics, I realized the power of data to drive decision-making — and that inspired me to pursue formal training in business analytics. Now, I’m looking to start my career as a data analyst, bringing a unique blend of scientific thinking, business insight, and technical skills.

I have hands-on experience with data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis using tools like Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I enjoy working with data to uncover trends, solve problems, and tell compelling stories.

This GitHub repository is where I share my projects, showcase my skills, and track my progress in data analytics and data science.
